### A Scrum Team has been working on a product for 9 Sprints. A new Product Owner who is new to Scrum joins the team and understands she is accountable for the Product Backlog. However, she is unsure about the purpose of the Product Backlog. She has read that the Product Backlog should be a list of all user features for the product.
